Slap the dog because cats rule a nice warm laptop for me to sit on and snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep so i see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy or howl on top of tall thing lick plastic bags. I can haz grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls. Dead stare with ears cocked wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again for my left donut is missing, as is my right yet freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep so lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody. Human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! i bet my nine lives on you-oooo-ooo-hooo claws in the eye of the beholder ccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttssssssssssssssss.
